CUDA Path Tracer
================

**University of Pennsylvania, CIS 565: GPU Programming and Architecture, Project 3**

* (TODO) YOUR NAME HERE
* Tested on: (TODO) Windows 22, i7-2222 @ 2.22GHz 22GB, GTX 222 222MB (Moore 2222 Lab)

### (TODO: Your README)

*DO NOT* leave the README to the last minute! It is a crucial part of the
project, and we will not be able to grade you without a good README.


Bug fixes:
seed the rng with the depth otherwise bad banding
offset new origin by surface normal not new direction
